  <!--
  There are three user types labTech, Guest and Student
  Their types will determine on what they can see and do
  -->
  <!--
  The front page has a search tool for the lab names (ex. GK306, LS202, VL205), it also has a sliding window to go home, preview the user's account
  (view and edit), preview reservations (view and edit), and logout.
  The db.js should also have a database for the reservations making sure that double bookings are prevented. 
  The search bar has a filter for which building and availability of the laboratory (basically exclude full labs)
  There are 3 slots per laboratory that can only be reserved by the labtech to allocate for walk-ins, but they can also reserve the walk-ins to any available laboratory seat
